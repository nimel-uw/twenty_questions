# twenty_questions

This is a program that imitates the game of Twenty Questions on the command line. In the game, a user starts by thinking of some object or other, and the computer's job is to guess it in under 20 questions. The "knowledge" that the computer uses to ask yes or no questions can be represented as a binary tree. This game can be played with a small default tree or using a loaded save file, which the user can (and should!) open to see or edit the questions that will be asked.

**instructions**

The command I used to compile:

    g++ -std=c++11 main.cpp

I run the resulting program with the command:

    ./a.out

with 0 or more flags afterwards.
